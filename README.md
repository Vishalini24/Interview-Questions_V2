# Interview-Questions_V2
 **a) String compression**
 **i) Memory usage and improvements**
**String compression code(First Compressor)**
#include<iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
void compress(string s)
{
 int num = s.length(); //calculating length of the string
 int i = 0; 
 while ( i < num) {
 // Counting the repetitions of each character 
 int repetition = 1;
 while (s[i] == s[i+1] && i < num-1 ) {
 repetition++;
 i++;
 } 
 // Print character and its count
 cout << s[i] << repetition;
 i++;
 }
}
The memory usage of this code depends on various factors such as the size of the input 
string etc. However, there are some ways to improve the code.
**Memory Usage:**
The primary memory usage in this code comes from the input string s and some local 
variables used within the functions.
The space complexity is O(1) because the memory used by local variables (e.g., num, i, 
repetition) is constant regardless of the size of the input.
**Improvements:**
• The function compress modifies the value of i within the loop. It's generally good 
practice to avoid modifying loop variables inside the loop header. We can consider using 
a for loop to make the code more readable.
• Although the space complexity is already low (O(1)), we can further optimize the code by 
avoiding unnecessary variables. For example, we can directly use s.length() in the loop 
condition without storing it in a separate variable.
• We can pass the input string as a const reference to avoid unnecessary copying of the 
string. This can help improve performance and memory usage, especially for large 
strings.
• Instead of directly printing characters to the console, we can use a stringstream or string 
to build the compressed string. This allows for better control over the output and avoids 
multiple calls to cout, which can be less efficient.
• If we know the approximate size of the compressed string, we can use reserve to 
preallocate memory for the string builder. This can reduce the number of reallocations 
and improve performance.
**ii) Second Compressor**
string secondCompress(string s)
{
 int num = s.length();
 string result = "";
 int i = 0;
 while (i < num)
 {
 char current_char = s[i];
 int repetition = 1;
 // Count repetitions of each character
 while (i + 1 < num && s[i] == s[i + 1])
 {
 repetition++;
 i++;
 }
 // Append character and its count to result
 result += current_char;
 if (repetition > 1)
 {
 result += to_string(repetition);
 }
 i++;
 }
 return result;
}
iii) Decompress string
void decompress(const string &s) {
 int num = s.length();
 int i = 0;
 while (i < num) {
 // Read character
 char character = s[i++];
 // Read count (variable number of digits)
 int count = 0;
 while (i < num && isdigit(s[i])) {
 count = count * 10 + (s[i++] - '0');
 }
 // Print the character repeated count times
 for (int j = 0; j < count; ++j) {
 cout << character;
 } } }

Boundary Cases:
Test the code on the boundaries of the input space, such as very long strings, strings with special 
characters, and strings with a mix of upper and lower case characters.
b) Linked List
i) kth to the last element of linked list
class Node {
 int data;
 Node next;
 Node(int data) {
 this.data = data;
 this.next = null;
 }
}
class LinkedList {
 Node head;
 LinkedList() {
 this.head = null;
 }
 // Insert a new node at the beginning of the linked list
 void push(int newData) {
 Node newNode = new Node(newData);
 newNode.next = head;
 head = newNode;
 }
 // Find the kth-to-last element of the linked list
 int findKthToLast(int k) {
 if (head == null || k <= 0) {
 System.out.println("Invalid input");
 return -1;
 }
 Node slowPointer = head;
 Node fastPointer = head;
 // Move the fast pointer k nodes ahead
 for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
 if (fastPointer == null) {
 System.out.println("Invalid input");
 return -1;
 }
 fastPointer = fastPointer.next;
 }
 // Move both pointers until the fast pointer reaches the end
 while (fastPointer != null) {
 slowPointer = slowPointer.next;
 fastPointer = fastPointer.next;
 }
 // Now, slowPointer is at the kth-to-last node
 return slowPointer.data;
 }
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 LinkedList list = new LinkedList();
 list.push(10);
 list.push(20);
 list.push(30);
 list.push(40);
 list.push(50);
 int k = 2;
 int kthToLast = list.findKthToLast(k);
 if (kthToLast != -1) {
 System.out.println("The " + k + "th-to-last element is: " + kthToLast);
 }
 }
}
ii) Minimize the number of times you run through the loop
// Move both pointers until the fast pointer reaches the end
 while (fastPointer.next != null) { // Changed the loop condition here
 slowPointer = slowPointer.next;
 fastPointer = fastPointer.next;
 }
c) Stack
i)Function ‘min’ 
import java.util.Stack;
class MinStack {
 private Stack<Integer> mainStack;
 private Stack<Integer> minStack;
 MinStack() {
 mainStack = new Stack<>();
 minStack = new Stack<>();
 }
 // Push element onto the stack
 void push(int value) {
 mainStack.push(value);
 // If the minStack is empty or the new element is smaller than or equal to the current 
minimum,
 // push the new element onto the minStack.
 if (minStack.isEmpty() || value <= minStack.peek()) {
 minStack.push(value);
 }
 }
 // Pop element from the stack
 void pop() {
 if (!mainStack.isEmpty()) {
 int poppedElement = mainStack.pop();
 // If the popped element is the current minimum, pop from the minStack as well.
 if (poppedElement == minStack.peek()) {
 minStack.pop();
 }
 }
 }
 // Get the minimum element in the stack
 int min() {
 if (!minStack.isEmpty()) {
 return minStack.peek();
 } else {
 System.out.println("Stack is empty.");
 return -1; // or throw an exception
 }
 }
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 MinStack stack = new MinStack();
 stack.push(3);
 stack.push(5);
 System.out.println("Minimum: " + stack.min()); // Output: 3
 stack.push(2);
 stack.push(1);
 System.out.println("Minimum: " + stack.min()); // Output: 1
 stack.pop();
 System.out.println("Minimum: " + stack.min()); // Output: 2
 stack.pop();
 System.out.println("Minimum: " + stack.min()); // Output: 3
 }
}
In this implementation, the minStack is used to keep track of the minimum element at each 
level of the main stack. The push operation checks whether the new element is smaller than 
or equal to the current minimum, and if so, it's pushed onto the minStack. The pop 
operation checks whether the popped element is the current minimum, and if so, it's also 
popped from the minStack. The min function returns the top element of the minStack, which 
represents the current minimum in the main stack.
ii) Real-world scenario
Let's consider a scenario where a user navigates through various web pages while browsing. 
The order in which the user visits these pages can be effectively managed using a stack. 
Here's how it works:
• Push Operation:
When the user opens a new page, the URL or page identifier is pushed onto the 
stack.
For each page visited, it gets added to the top of the stack.
• Pop Operation:
When the user clicks the "Back" button, the most recent page is popped from the 
stack.
This operation allows the user to navigate back to the previously visited page.
• Comparison with Arrays:
Using an array to store the browsing history might involve unnecessary resizing and 
shifting of elements when navigating back and forth.
While a stack allows for efficient operations as elements are always inserted and 
removed from the top.
• Benefits of Using a Stack:
The order of page visits is naturally maintained using the Last In First Out (LIFO) 
property of the stack.
The stack ensures that the user goes back to the exact previous page visited, 
preserving the navigation history.
It simplifies the management of the browsing history by keeping track of the visited 
pages in a structured manner.
d) Trapping rain water
public static int maxWater(int[] arr, int n) 
{
// To store the maximum water 
// that can be stored 
int res = 0; 
// For every element of the array 
// except first and last element 
for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) { 
// Find maximum element on its left 
int left = arr[i]; 
 for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) { 
left = Math.max(left, arr[j]); 
} 
// Find maximum element on its right 
int right = arr[i]; 
for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) { 
right = Math.max(right, arr[j]); 
} 
// Update maximum water value 
res += Math.min(left, right) - arr[i]; 
} 
return res; 
} 
For input => int[] arr = { 2 ,1, 3 ,0, 1, 2, 3}; // Output : 7
e) Coin Change
Scenario 1: Base Case (Change is 0)
You need to provide change, but the change required is zero.
Explanation:
If no change is needed, there's no need to give any coins.
Optimal Solution: An empty set of coins.
Scenario 2: Negative Change
The amount of change required is negative (e.g., -5).
Explanation:
It doesn't make sense to give negative change.
Optimal Solution: Indicate that change is not possible.
Scenario 3: Dynamic Programming Approach
You have a list of coin denominations and a specific amount of change to provide.
Explanation:
Create a list to keep track of the minimum number of coins needed for each possible amount of 
change. For each coin denomination, figure out the minimum number of coins needed to make up 
each amount of change.
Scenario 4: Building the Solution
You have the dynamic programming list filled with minimum coin counts.
Explanation:
Start from the end of the list (representing the given change).
Move backward, selecting the coin that contributes to the minimum number of coins needed at each 
step.
As you backtrack, you're building the combination of coins that gives the optimal solution
ii) Greedy Algorithm and Dynamic Programming
Greedy Algorithm:
A greedy algorithm is an approach to problem-solving that makes locally optimal choices at each 
stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. It makes the best possible decision at each step 
without considering the consequences of that decision on future steps. Greedy algorithms are 
particularly useful for optimization problems where a series of choices need to be made to maximize 
or minimize some objective function.
Dynamic Programming:
Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into 
simpler overlapping subproblems.Dynamic programming is particularly useful when a problem 
exhibits optimal substructure, meaning an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from 
optimal solutions of its subproblems.
Role of Dynamic Programming with Greedy Algorithms:
* Overlapping Subproblems:
Greedy algorithms don't typically involve solving the same subproblem multiple times.
Dynamic programming is particularly beneficial when a problem has overlapping subproblems, and 
solutions to the same subproblems are reused.
*Memoization:
Dynamic programming often uses memoization, where solutions to subproblems are stored in a 
table.
This can improve the efficiency of the algorithm by avoiding redundant computations.
*Optimizing Greedy Choices:
Dynamic programming can be used to optimize the choices made by a greedy algorithm.
By storing and reusing solutions to subproblems, dynamic programming can enhance the efficiency 
of a greedy algorithm.
*Example: Shortest Path Problem:
Dijkstra's algorithm, a greedy algorithm for finding the shortest path, can be optimized using 
dynamic programming techniques.
iii) Largest Possible Number
Example => Input: 19374
1. Choose 1 (current maximum), remove it => Remaining: 9375
2. Choose 9 (current maximum), remove it => Remaining: 375
3. Choose 3 (current maximum), remove it => Remaining: 75
4. Choose 7 (current maximum), remove it => Remaining: 5
5. Choose 5 (current maximum), remove it => Remaining: (empty)
Output: 9375
This problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The intuition behind the greedy approach in 
this case is to iteratively choose the current maximum digit as long as it doesn't compromise the 
overall goal of creating the largest number.
Explanation
Start from the Left:
Iterate through the digits from left to right.
For each digit, consider removing it if doing so results in a larger number.
Greedy Choice:
At each step, choose the current maximum digit.
The goal is to always have the largest possible digit as the leftmost digit.
Remove One Digit:
Remove the chosen digit, and continue the process with the remaining digits.
Repeat the process until the ultimate goal is achieved.
Why is this a Greedy Algorithm?
The choice made at each step (removing a digit) is based solely on the local optimal of selecting the 
current maximum digit. The algorithm doesn't consider the global context of all possible 
combinations of digits. Despite this, the algorithm often produces the correct and optimal result, 
demonstrating the greedy choice property.
f) Dot Product and Cross Product
Dot Product:
Definition: The dot product, also known as the scalar product, is a binary operation that takes two 
equal-length sequences of numbers and returns a single number. It is defined as the sum of the 
product of corresponding entries.
Formula: For two vectors A and B, the dot product is given by A · B = |A| * |B| * cos(θ), where θ is 
the angle between the vectors.
Use Cases in Graphics:
Cosine of the Angle: Dot product is used to find the cosine of the angle between two vectors. This is 
crucial in lighting calculations, where knowing the angle between the light source and the surface 
normal is important for shading.
Projection: It's used to find the projection of one vector onto another, which is useful in various 
geometric and physics calculations.
Cross Product:
Definition: The cross product is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space, 
producing another vector that is perpendicular to both input vectors.
Formula: For two vectors A and B, the cross product is given by A x B = |A| * |B| * sin(θ) * n, where 
θ is the angle between the vectors, and n is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane formed by A 
and B.
Use Cases in Graphics:
Surface Normal: Cross product is commonly used to find the surface normal of a polygon. This 
normal is crucial for lighting calculations and determining how light interacts with the surface.
Rotation: Cross product is used in rotation calculations and determining orientation in 3D space.

h) Random crashes in a software application can be challenging to diagnose and fix. Here are some 
approaches
1. Review the Code:
Start by thoroughly reviewing the code for any obvious issues, such as null pointer dereferences, 
uninitialized variables, or buffer overflows.
Utilize static code analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities and coding errors.
2. Debugging Techniques:
Use a debugger to catch the crash when it occurs.
Examine the call stack, variables, and memory to understand the state of the application during the 
crash.
Look for memory-related issues, such as accessing freed memory or writing to read-only memory
3. Logging and Error Handling:
Introduce comprehensive logging to record the program state leading up to the crash.
Examine the logs to identify patterns or commonalities that may hint at the cause.
Ensure robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations and prevent crashes
4. Environment and Dependencies:
Verify that the application's dependencies are up to date and compatible with each other.
Check if variations in environment variables contribute to the crashes.
5. Concurrency and Thread Safety:
Investigate potential race conditions or deadlock situations in a multithreaded environment.
Verify that shared data structures are accessed safely by multiple threads.
6. Resource Utilization:
Check for resource limits, such as reaching maximum file descriptors, memory, or CPU usage.
Look for memory leaks that may accumulate over time.
7. Dynamic Analysis Tools:
Use dynamic analysis tools, such as AddressSanitizer or Valgrind, to detect memory issues.
Apply fuzz testing to generate random inputs and discover potential edge cases.
8. Compiler and Optimization Settings:
Examine compiler flags and optimization settings. Sometimes, aggressive optimizations may 
introduce subtle bugs.
9.Memory Hierarchy:
Analyze how the application interacts with the memory hierarchy (caches, RAM).
Cache misses or memory contention can impact performance and stability.
10.Processor Architecture:
Understand the specifics of the underlying processor architecture.
Instruction reordering, out-of-order execution, or memory consistency models may contribute to 
issues.
11.Interrupts and Exception Handling:
Investigate if interrupts or exceptions are affecting the program flow.
12.Hardware Failures:
Consider the possibility of hardware issues, such as faulty RAM or overheating.
13.Low-Level Profiling:
Use low-level profiling tools to analyze CPU and memory usage at the assembly level.
14.Compiler Intrinsic Functions:
Check if the code uses compiler intrinsic functions that are architecture-dependent.
